    <td width="648"><p class="gardeningpara">Even if you just have a little yard or  outdoor living space, you can still have a beautiful garden. There are several  ways to turn a tiny space into a huge garden area with little effort and, in  most cases, no money out of pocket. Whether you live in an apartment with only  tarmac for a yard or have a little yard that doesn't seem big enough for a  garden, we've compiled a list of fantastic small garden ideas for you to try  this spring.<br>
      With spring and planting season just around  the corner, now is the perfect time to pick a small-space garden design and get  started. Many of these suggestions are excellent even if you have a large  garden but want something a little closer to your home. Whether you want to  grow veggies, flowers, or create your own herb garden, this large variety is  guaranteed to offer a garden concept for your little space.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        1. Repurposed Furniture Garden <br>
      With some old furniture that you were  preparing to toss out, you may create a lovely outdoor space. Planting bases  can be made from of old dressers. Simply place the plants in individual pots  and store them in the drawers. You'll end up with a three-tiered garden that's  both attractive and practical. If you don't already have an old dresser, you  can probably get one for a few bucks at a yard sale or flea market, and then  all you have to do is start planting. Recycled Upside-Down Garden Recycling is  a cost-effective and space-saving solution. Apartment dwellers will love this repurposed  upside down garden idea, or you can simply hang your plants on your porch if  you have one. You only need to select the containers you wish to use and then  follow the directions for hanging your plants correctly so that they grow as  they should. This is a terrific way to display flowers, herbs, and various  vegetables while also saving space.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        2.  Vertical  Garden <br>
      Building a vertical garden with a shoe  organizer is a brilliant idea. This garden not only looks amazing and saves  space, but it also keeps pests and pets away from your herbs and vegetables.  All you have to do now is fill each shoe space with potting soil or compost  before adding your plants. Make sure your hanging gets enough sunlight for the  plants, and if there is no cover from the rain overhead, you will need to water  them on a regular basis.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        3. Hanging Gutter Garden <br>
      A stunning hanging garden may be made out  of old guttering. The amount of guttering you'll need is determined by the size  of the garden you're planning. Gutter gardens make use of the vertical space in  your yard, allowing you to grow flowers, herbs, and veggies even if you don't  have much of a grass. Just make sure you pick a location that receives a few  hours of direct sunshine each day. Gutter gardens can also act as a natural  privacy fence or divider in your garden.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        4. Kitchen Fairy Garden <br>
      You don't have to employ fairies in this  garden, but the entire concept is fantastic for small places. A container is  required. An ancient wooden barrel serves as the planting's foundation in this  instance. Once you've got a container, all you have to do now is start filling  it up with dirt and smaller containers. In this garden, you'll see a muffin tin  that's ideal for smaller herbs. You could also use ordinary terra cotta pots or  any other container. If you want to achieve a kitchen look, old pots and pans  are ideal.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        5. Vertical Pallet Garden<br>
      An old pallet, or several, can be  transformed into the ideal planter for vertical gardens. Vertical planters are  fantastic even if you have a vast outdoor space because they conserve space and  are quite appealing to look at. They can be used to expand your current garden  area, allowing you to plant more flowers, herbs, or vegetables. All you have to  do now is secure your terra cotta pots to the pallets using zip ties or  something similar, and then decide what to plant.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        6. Kiddie Pool Garden<br>
      If you don't want to rip up your lawn or  don't have one, an old plastic kiddie pool makes an excellent raised garden  bed. You might go in and cover the pool with stones or bricks if you want to  make it more appealing. All you have to do now is fill the pool with soil or  compost and start planting. This is advantageous since you may remove the pool  over the winter if desired, and then reinstall it when planting season arrives.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        7. Portable Container Garden <br>
      Container gardens are convenient since they  can be moved around. You may move them if you need to, and you won't have to  worry about grass regrowing in your garden. A colorful container garden,  whether you have a fence or deck, is a terrific way to add a little beauty to  the area while also saving space for your planting. Choose colorful bucket  planters and hang them on your fence or from windowsills and other locations  around the house.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        8. Tiered Garden<br>
      For tiny places, tiered gardens are ideal.  If you just have a small amount of area for flowers or vegetables, a few terra  cotta pots can be used to create a beautiful tiered garden. You can plant  whatever you want in the planters once they're piled, and depending on how many  planters you use, you can have as many plants as you like. If you want, you can  use plastic planters, but the terra cotta ones are more durable and will last  much longer. This is a terrific yearly garden idea, especially if you want  something colorful on your porch.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        9. Garden Bench Planters <br>
      The addition of benches and other  decorations to small garden spaces should not be a problem. In fact, you could  add a lovely bench and then use it as a plant stand. This is an excellent solution  for outdated seats that you can no longer sit on. Simply use the seat to hold  your planters, or get very creative and use a bench without a seat by  suspending the plants or making a raised garden from the seat space.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        10. Hanging Tin Can Garden<br>
      You can recycle old tin cans and put them  in your garden. You may just paint some tin cans and use them as planters if  you don't have enough space to grow all of the flowers, herbs, or vegetables  you want. These look great hung from fences, decks, or even the side of a  house. Painted tin cans can be used to construct a full garden on the side of a  fence, and they are portable so you can move them about as needed.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        11. Wooden Fence Planter Boxes<br>
      Simply hang planter boxes from your fence  to create a garden area. You merely need to fill terra cotta planters with your  plants once the boxes are in place. This is a great small garden idea for those  of you who don't have much of a yard but yet want to grow fresh herbs,  vegetables, and flowers. Different planters can be used to add color, and the  boxes are simple to create out of old wood pieces.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        12. Vertical Garden Tower<br>
      This vertical tower is a great addition to  even the tiniest garden spaces. It's simple to construct, and once it's  finished, simply add the plants you desire, which will all be contained within  the vertical framework. If you want to add more plants, make it taller, or make  it shorter and add a few to your garden area. It's a lot easy than it appears,  and you'll save a lot of money over buying one that's already built.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        13. Elevated Gardens <br>
      Elevated garden boxes can be built and used  throughout your landscaping. If you don't have much of a yard and want to  maintain your garden on the deck or porch, these are ideal. Simply construct  the boxes to the desired height. It's worth noting that you don't have to  design them with legs. Elevated garden boxes are popular and can be used to  decorate steps, decks, and other tiny garden areas. To give depth to your  garden space, you can build stackable boxes or make them in different sizes.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        14. Vertical Soda Bottle Garden<br>
      This vertical soda bottle garden is a  terrific way to display plants or cultivate vegetables on fences. You also get  the extra benefit of being able to recycle and reuse those 2-liter beverage  bottles. The garden's essence is really straightforward. Simply cut the edge of  the bottles off and plant whatever you wish in the empty hole. This is a  fantastic herb garden idea. You can hang the bottles on the side of the house,  directly outside the kitchen door, to make it easy to get to your herbs.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        15. Patio Umbrella Garden<br>
      You can repurpose a large planter and use  it as a holder for your patio umbrella if you have a small patio and want to  incorporate some green. You'll only need pipes to hold the umbrella, and you'll  need to decide the plants or flowers you'd like to put next to you while  sitting outside. You could even get really creative and use a tiered planter to  add a few more plants and create a mini flower garden right next to your seats.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        16. Garden Fountain <br>
      Smaller gardens benefit from fountains.  They are not only simple to construct, but they also lend dimension to any  garden, making it appear larger. A fountain can be made out of a variety of  materials, and depending on how you make it, you might be able to include some  plants in the design. This combines the soothing sound of water with the  lushness of gorgeous flowers or plants to create a soothing environment. For  people who don't have much yard to plant, some fountain designs may be great  for decks or patios.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        17. Suspended String Garden <br>
      This is a cute way to cultivate those  plants, and it's ideal for little spaces. These suspended string containers are  a terrific option if you don't have enough space for a garden or just want to  add a little flair to your porch or patio. Instead of worrying about land, you  may just make use of the space above you. These would also look fantastic  hanging from trellises or other structures in or near your garden.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        18. Pathway Gardening<br>
      You may still have a great route even if  you don't have a lot of room, and alongside that pathway is the ideal spot for  planting. Outlining a garden path with small shrubs, hostas, and other leafy  plants looks lovely. You may design a path through your yard or a small garden  out of any number of materials, and you can conserve space and make your path  appear even more lovely by using the path's outline for planting. If you  already have a path – whether it leads to the garden or to the sidewalk – use  the space beside it to grow plants and flowers.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        19. Cinder Wall Garden<br>
      With cinder blocks, you can create a  beautiful garden wall that holds numerous plants. This is perfect for smaller  yards and can be built right next to the fence. You can toggle the blocks  however you want to create different planting areas and to make the entire unit  unique.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        20. Balcony Gardens<br>
      Even if you only have a balcony or a tiny  deck, you can still create a lush garden space that is ideal for relaxing  during the summer. You can use full, mature plants for your balcony garden,  contrary to popular belief. You'll need to plant in containers, but there's no  end to the beauty you can add to your balcony, and mixing larger plants with  smaller ones creates a lovely garden area that takes up far less space than you  might think.</p>
      <p class="gardeningpara"><br>
        21. Mix Plant Gardens <br>
    You can mix the plants in each container to  make them more colorful and give them depth if you're growing in containers.  This gives the impression of a much larger garden while just taking up a little  amount of space. To acquire more beauty per square inch, combine hanging  foliage with flowers. Many diverse plants grow nicely together and look lovely  in containers when mixed together. Plus, even if you only have a few pots to  deal with, you get to use as many flowers and greenery as you want.</p></td>
